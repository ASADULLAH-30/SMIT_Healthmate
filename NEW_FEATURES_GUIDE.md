{
  id: 1730819234567,
  fileName: "medical_report.pdf",
  fileSize: 1024576,
  uploadDate: "2024-10-19T15:30:00.000Z",

## 📖 Translation System

### How It Works:

4. Easy to add more languages in future

### Adding New Translations:
Edit `client/src/context/LanguageContext.jsx`:

```javascript
export const translations = {
  en: {
    newKey: "English text",
  },
  ur: {
    newKey: "Roman Urdu text",
  }
};
```

### Using in Components:
```javascript
import { useLanguage } from "../context/LanguageContext";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { t } = useLanguage();
  
  return <h1>{t("newKey")}</h1>;
};
```
