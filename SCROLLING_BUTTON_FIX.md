# ✅ Scrolling & Button Fixed!

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Added Scrollbar to Content Section**
- Changed layout from `justify-center` to normal flow
- Added `overflow-y-auto` to main content area
- Removed `h-full` that was causing centering issues
- Content now scrolls properly when it overflows

### 2. ✅ **Made Analyze Button IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS**
- **HUGE size**: 80px min-height, text-2xl
- **Animated pulse**: Constantly pulsing to draw attention
- **Spinning sparkles**: Icons spin to catch the eye
- **Border-4**: Thick border for visibility
- **Uppercase text**: "ANALYZE PDF NOW!"
- **Shows only when**: File uploaded AND not loading
- **Position**: Always visible in scroll area
