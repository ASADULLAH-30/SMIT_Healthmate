3. ✅ Better error messages
4. ✅ File validation
5. ✅ Step-by-step progress tracking

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Frontend (`client/src/components/GeminiPdf.jsx`)

**Before:**
- No detailed logging
- Alert popups for errors
- Required manual prompt

**After:**
- ✅ Console logs every step
- ✅ Red error box with details
- ✅ Auto-prompt if left empty
- ✅ Progress indicators

**What You'll See in Browser Console:**
```
📤 Uploading PDF: report.pdf
📡 Sending request to backend...
📥 Response status: 200
📦 Response data: { text: "..." }
✅ PDF analysis complete!
```

---

### Backend (`backend/server.js`)

**Already Working:**
- ✅ PDF parsing with pdf-parse
- ✅ Gemini 2.0 Flash integration
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Progress logging

**What You'll See in Backend Console:**
```
📄 Processing PDF: report.pdf

## ❌ Most Common Issues

### 1. PDF is Image-Based (Scanned)
**Problem:** PDF contains only images, no text  
**How to Check:** Open PDF, try to select text with mouse  
**Solution:** Use a PDF with actual text, or use OCR tool first

### 2. Backend Not Running
**Problem:** Backend server stopped  
**Check:** Go to http://localhost:3000 (should show "Server is running.")  
**Solution:** Run `npm run dev` in backend folder

### 3. Wrong API URL
**Problem:** Frontend can't find backend  
**Check:** `client/.env` should have `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000`  
**Solution:** Fix URL and restart frontend

### 4. No Gemini API Key
**Problem:** Backend can't call Gemini  
**Check:** `backend/.env` should have `GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIza...`  
**Solution:** Add API key and restart backend

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### If Upload Fails Immediately:

3. Check file size (max 10MB)

### If Upload Succeeds but No Response:
1. Check backend console for errors
2. Look for Gemini API errors
3. Verify API key is valid
4. Check internet connection

### If Response is Error:
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check if it's about the PDF (text extraction)
3. Check if it's about the API (configuration)
4. Try a different PDF file
